# Introduction
**Landing Webpage**
<br />This webpage is a simple execution of the navigation menu and multiple HTML links. The landing webpage was my favorite project from the udacity course. This project helped increase my knowledge on Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  

This website utilizes the navigation menu, where the user can scroll through multiple webpage links. Some of the links are connected to other projects I've worked on.

# History
**Week 1**
<br />*__Udacity Starter code__*
<br />linking `js/main.js`, `index.html` and `style.css` by using
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css''>` and `<!-- --><script src="main.js''></script>`. What I learn from this starter code is always use the href attribute to link your files or even projects.The `href`attribute is always convenient, especially for linking all types of files with cool looking effects. If you need to make 10 files 'like me' or more, you'll be able to do as plenty as you want. Always remember to keep your files and folder organized. 

**Week 2**
<br />*__Implementing Navigation Menu, Home Page, and Importing Images__*
<br /> I followed the Udacity video to begin the navigation menu on the landing webpage. At first It was just a basic navigation menu with 4 buttons and 4 images, then I realized that just having 4 buttons and 4 images with nothing interesting to see. So I decided to not only look at Udacity videos for help, but also the resources it offers. I did a lot of research on YouTube and w3schools with information that were relevant. 

**Week 3**
<br /> *__Implementing Smooth Scroll__*
<br />I wanted to expand my project and make it more interesting. With the help from the resources gathered like w3schools, youtube.com, TraversyMedia.com. I began to learn the smooth scroll effect for my `js/main.js`. Smooth Scroll is such a cool effect for a landing webpage, especially for a beginners page. If you change the number for the scroll to a higher number you'll get a faster effect. Same goes for slow effect, just lower the number of the Scroll.

**Week 4**
<br />*__Discovering different methods for improving the landing webpage__*
<br />When I began to discover and learn Javascript Keywords.let, const, booleans, loops, events, functions. Knowledging Attributes like `<a>, <button>,<script>, <style>, <link>, <input>` link href. Swotting in CSS Properties like Margins and Paddings, background-color background-image background-position background-repeatbackground-size, etc. I was able to make different pages and add gifs instead of regular images.I even replace the images that was in the LandPage to gifs.

**Week 5**
<br />*__Daily Clock and ShoeShop Section__*
<br />Traverse Media,Youtube.com, and w3schools.com were really good resources to help improve my project.The Clock and ShoeShop took quite some time, but with the help of the resources from Udacity, I was able to get the Clock Running and Shoe Images for my ShoeShop in a equal position. I had a lot of code bugs that had to be debugged, especially the code for ShoeShop. Daily Clock didn't have a lot of bugs, but I was struggling to get the night picture to stop repeating whenever the time reaches 'Good Evening'. Always make sure when coding a clock, never leave no-repeat out of body { } in css file.  

**Week 6**
<br />*__Youtube, Linkedin and Udacity Section__*
<br />With My Resources from Udacity and other relevant sites in order to make the buttons and links for Html And CSS work. It was a struggle but eventually I was able to get the links working for my LandPage and it turned out to be a success. 


`<section id = "Youtube">`<br />`<h1><a href="https://youtu.be/_R-BD2DY46I"><button type="button" class="button button4">Vans HOW IT'S MADE</button></h1></a> </section>`       
   
   
`<section id = "Linkedin">` <br />`<h1><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><button type="button" class="button button5">Linkedin</button></h1></a></section>`
   
   
`<section id = "Udacity">` <br />`<h1><a href="https://www.udacity.com/"><button type= "button"class="button button6">Udacity The Best Coding School</button></h1></a></section>`

**Week 7**
<br />*__Blog and Weather Application Section__*
<br />This was the toughest part of the project, trying to get all 3 projects linked together. 
In the end I was able to accomplish the task. LiveServer was able to get LandPage Linking with Weather Application, but unfortunately Blog wasn't able to work with
LiveServer. It only works when I grab the file url that's in properties. So if anyone knows how to fix this issue, feel free to give it a try and let me know. 
If you want, you can also try adding and linking your own projects into the landing webpage.

**Week 8**
<br />*__Music Section and README.md__*
<br/> For this last week, I completed the project by implementing a Christmas Music Section to the landing webpage. By clicking on the button within this section, you can play and listen to the music. Lastly, I created a README.md file to describe the project in depth. I really enjoy working on this project after a month and half. The landing webpage is a project I can really show off and interpret to others. 

# Future Additions
- Addition to the README.md
- Project Refactoring 
- Implementing other HTML files using LIVE SERVER
- Improving Performance, Navigation Menu, and Error Handling
- Implementing User Log-In
