# History
**Week 1**
<br />*__Udacity Starter code__*
<br />linking js/app.js index.html and/style.css by using
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css">` and
  `<!-- --><script src="main.js"></scrip>` Note to yourself Always use the href attribute to link your files or even projects.
  href attribute always comes in convenient, especially for linking all types of files with cool looking effects and beneficials.
  So if you need the feel to make 10 files 'like me' or more, you'll be able to do as plenty as you want. Always remmeber to keep your files and folder organize.
  especially when your coding a project for a good cause.

**Week 2**
<br />*__Implementing Navigation Menu, Home Page, and Importing Images__*
<br /> I followed the Udacity video to begin the Navbar on landpageAt first It was just a basic navbar with 4 buttons and 4 images. I realized that just having 4 buttons and 4 images with noting intersting to see, is too boring.So I decided to not only look at Udacity videos for help, but also the resources it offers. I do alot of research on the internet, especially youtube.com and with the helpfrom different sites that explains coding "like w3schools. the information was very crucially relevant. 

**Week 3**
<br /> *__Implementing Smooth Scroll__*
<br />I wanted to expand my project. With Udacity's help of giving out helpful
resources like developer.mozillia.org, CSS Stlye Guide, JavaScript Style Guide, Html Style Guide, Stackoverflow, etc.
Later, I began to go on w3schools, youtube.com, TraversyMedia.com and learn the smooth scroll effect
with my js/app.js. Smoooth Scroll is such a cool effect for a landing Page, especially for a beginners Page. If you change the number for the scroll to a higher number
you'll get a faster effect. Same goes for slow effect, just lower the number of the Scroll.

**Week 4**
<br />*__Discovering different methods for improving the landing webpage__*
<br />When I began to discover and learn let, cosnt, booleans, loops, events, functions, attributes like `<a>, <button>,<script>, <style>, <link>, <input>` link href. Swotting in CSS Properties like Margins and Paddings, background-color background-image background-position background-repeatbackground-size, etc. I was able to make different pages and add gifs instead of regular images.I even replace the images that was in the LandPage to gifs.

**Week 5**
<br />*__Daily Clock and ShoeShop Section__*
<br />Traverse Media,Youtube.com, and w3schools.com were really good resources to help improve my project.The Clock and ShoeShop took quite some time, but with the help of the resources from Udacity, I was able to get the Clock Running and Shoe Images for my ShoeShop in a equal position. I had a lot of code bugs s that had to be debugged, especially the code for ShoeShop. Daily Clock didn't had a lot of bugs, but I was struggling of getting the night picture to stop repeating whenever the time reaches 'Good Evening'. Always make sure when coding a clock, never leave no-repeat out of body { } in css file.  

**Week 6**
<br />*__Youtube, Linkedin and Udacity Section__*
<br />With My Resources from Udacity and other relevant sites in order to make the buttons and links for Html And CSS work. It was a struggle but eventually I was able to get the links working for my LandPage and it turn out to be a success. 


`<section id = "Youtube">`<br />`<h1><a href="https://youtu.be/_R-BD2DY46I"><button type="button" class="button button4">Vans HOW IT'S MADE</button></h1></a> </section>`       
   
   
`<section id = "Linkedin">` <br />`<h1><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"><button type="button" class="button button5">Likedin</button></h1></a></section>`
   
   
`<section id = "Udacity">` <br />`<h1><a href="https://www.udacity.com/"><button type= "button"class="button button6">Udacity The Best Coding School</button></h1></a></section>`

**Week 7**
<br />*__Blog and Weather Application Section__*
<br />This was the toughest part of the project, trying to get all 3 projects link together. 
In the end I was able to accomplish the task. LiveServer was able to get LandPage Linking with Weather Application, but unfortunately with Blog, it was able to work.
It only work when I grab the file url that's in properties. So if anyone knows how to fix this issue, feel free to give it a try and let me know.

**Week 8**
<br />*__Music Section and README.md__*
<br/>Finally, getting the Christmas Music playing and linking my LandPage to the Readme was very succesful.
This Project took quite a while to get everything working; debugging code, getting the gifs and images in the right postion and link with code.
Linking all the pages together and and keeping files and folders organized; but in the end it was all worth it. Now you can sit back, get yourself a cup of coffee, or 
hot chocolate with marshmallows, put on your favorite christmas pajamas, and relax while listening to the best Christmas song. Also while you're at it, have a look at the README.md I reall enjoyed making this Landing Page Project. Even though I had to put alot of hours in it, It was by far the most relevant Project that Udacity has assigned me too.
