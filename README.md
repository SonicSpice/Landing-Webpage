# History
**Week 1**
<br />**Udacity Starter code**
<br />linking js/app.js index.html and/style.css by using

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css">` and

  `<!-- --><script src="main.js"></scrip>`

**Week 2**
<br />**Implementing Navigation Menu, Home Page, and Importing Images**
<br />I followed the Udacity video to begin the Navbar on landpage
At first It was just a basic navbar with 4 buttons and 4 images

**Week 3**
<br /> **Implementing Smooth Scroll**
<br />I wanted to expand my project. With Udacity's help of giving out helpful
resources like developer.mozillia.org, CSS Stlye Guide, etc.
Later, I began to go on w3schools, youtube.com, TraversyMedia.com and learn the smooth scroll effect
with my js/app.js

**Week 4**
<br />**Discovering different methods for improving the landing webpage**
<br />When I began to discover and learn let, cosnt, booleans, loops, events, functions, attributes, link href
Properties like Margins and Paddings, etc. I was able to make different pages add gifs instead of a regular image.
I even replace the images that was in the LandPage to gifs.

**Week 5**
<br />**Daily Clock and ShoeShop Section**
<br />Traverse Media,Youtube.com, and w3schools.com were really good resources to help improve my project.
The Clock and ShoeShop took quite some time, but with the help of the resources from Udacity, I was
able to get the Clock Running and Shoe Images for my ShoeShop in a equal position.

**Week 6**
<br />**Youtube and Linkedin Section**
<br />With My Resources to help make the buttons and links for Html And Css. Getting the
Them to work for my LandPage was successful

**Week 7**
<br />**Blog and Weather Application Section**
<br />This was the toughest part of the project, trying to get all 3 projects link together.
In the end I was able to accomplish the task.

**Week 8**
<br />**Music Section and README.md**
<br/>Finally, getting the Christmas Music playing and linking my LandPage to the Readme was very succesful.
This Project took quite a while to get everything working; debugging code, getting the gifs and images in the right postion and link with code.
Linking all the pages together and and keeping files and folders organized; but in the end it was all worth it.
I reall enjoyed making this Landing Page Project. Even though I had to put alot of hours in it, It was by far the most relevant Project that Udacity has assigned me too.
