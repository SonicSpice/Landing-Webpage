Introduction:
Landing Page  
 This is my favorite project, It was alot to learn but it was worth it in the end.
This Landing Page started off short with just a simple page and navbar, but I just had to see what else there was to improve it more.

History:
Week 1
Fork and Cloning the Udacity github starter code
linking js/app.js index.html and/style.css by using

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css">` and

  <!-- --><script src="main.js"></scrip>

Week 2
Creating Navbar with Images
I followed the Udacity video to begin the Navbar on landpage
At first It was just a basic navbar with 4 buttons and 4 images

Week 3
Smooth Scroll
I wanted to expand my project. With Udacity's help of giving out helpful
resources like developer.mozillia.org, CSS Stlye Guide, etc.
Later, I began to go on w3schools, youtube.com, TraversyMedia.com and learn the smooth scroll effect
with my js/app.js

Week 4
Discovering different methods on improving the Landing Page
When I began to discover and learn let, cosnt, booleans, loops, events, functions, attributes, link href
Properties like Margins and Paddings, etc. I was able to make different pages add gifs instead of a regular image.
I even replace the images that was in the LandPage to gifs.

Week 5
Making Clock and ShoeShop
Traverse Media,Youtube.com, and w3schools.com were really good resources to help improve my project.
The Clock and ShoeShop took quite some time, but with the help of the resources from Udacity, I was
able to get the Clock Running and Shoe Images for my ShoeShop in a equal position.

Week 6
Adding Links: Youtube.com linkedin.com and the best school Udacity.com
With My Resources to help make the buttons and links for Html And Css. Getting the
Them to work for my LandPage was successful

Week 7
Linking Blog(Project1) and Weather.App(Project3) to LandPage :
This was the toughest part of the project, trying to get all 3 projects link together.
In the end I was able to accomplish the task.

Week 8
Linking Music and Wring This Readme
Finally, getting the Christmas Music playing and linking my LandPage to the Readme was very succesful.
This Project took quite a while to get everything working; debugging code, getting the gifs and images in the right postion and link with code.
Linking all the pages together and and keeping files and folders organized; but in the end it was all worth it.
I reall enjoyed making this Landing Page Project. Even though I had to put alot of hours in it, It was by far the most relevant Project that Udacity has assigned me too.
